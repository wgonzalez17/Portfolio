This project is being made to help a mold injection company to keep track of assets. Answering questions like "what is what" and "where is what" when it comes to reviewing assets and their details/locations. The project will have two parts, the first part is the web UI/application which is made from HTML/CSS for visual web content and programmed in PHP for backend processing. The second part is the database that will hold all the data which is also made using MySQL.
