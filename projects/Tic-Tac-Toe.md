This project was for a final project back in 2025 in one of my visual programming courses. We were given several choices on what we wanted to create as our final project and I chose to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The goal was to create the app using Windows Forms using Visual Studio and the selected programming language was C#. The requirements for this game was for the player to play against the computer, update and display win, lose or tie scores, and to include a score reset button. With a timeline of a week, I was able to create a working game with a main menu, a loading screen with game tips, and with an "End Game" button. All requirements were met along with proper error handling and pop ups of the winner.
